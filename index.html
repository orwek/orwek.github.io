			<h3>Web Developer</h3>
			<p>
			  I have eight years of experience as a web developer. I have worked with content management systems, publishing systems, and responsive design. I am fluent in the following languages and frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, Bootstrap, Skeleton, Node.js, PHP, and MySQL.

			<h3>JavaScript</h3>
			<p>
				My passion for JavaScript probably stems from the time I owned a low end smartphone. Because of the limited memory I could only have a handful of apps installed at a time. To remedy this, I started writing my own web apps that could run in smartphone's browser. The first of these was a simple dice rolling app. From there I started writing games in JavaScript, and the rest as they say is history.
			</p>
			<p>
				The thing I love the most about writing games is the opportunity to explore parts of a programming language that I don't normally use in my day to day work. This in turn makes me a better programmer because I am more familiar with the language, and I can use what I have learned in my regular work projects.
			</p>

				Here are some samples of my JavaScript Games and Applications (Business related examples available upon request):
			</p>
				<a href="http://orwek.github.io/scribe" target="_blank" class="btn drop_dark" style="clear:both;">Scribe</a>
				<p> 
					Scribe is a word processor similar to Scrivener. It uses JSON and Local Storage to save your files. You can also export your data file so you can create a backup, or if you would like to use a different browser on a different computer.
				</p>
				<a href="http://orwek.github.io/5x/spyhunt.html" target="_blank" class="btn drop_dark" style="clear:both;">Spy Hunt</a>
				<p>
					I wrote Spy Hunt on my Android phone. (Yes, with the touchscreen keyboard.) It uses the andi framework which I also wrote on my phone. It is a browser based game where you try to find three spies who are hiding in the city, and the difficulty is set by the number of agents you have to search the city.
				</p>
				<a href="http://orwek.github.io/5x/d6roller.html" target="_blank" class="btn drop_dark" style="clear:both;">d6 Dice Roller</a>
				<p>
					I wrote this dice application while on vacation. I only had my phone with me, so I created the andi framework to provide functionality similar to jQuery and Bootstrap, but that was easier to type on a phone. I also wrote an error console so I could see the browser's error log on my phone.
				</p>
				<a href="http://orwek.github.io/cia.js" target="_blank" class="btn drop_dark" style="clear:both;">CIA Text Adventure</a>
				<p>
					This text adventure was originally written in BASIC and I rewrote it in JavaScript using JSON as the data structure. By using JSON, the program went from 7000 lines of code down to just over 1500. The next step for this project is to rework the parser so that you can write an entire text adventure via a properly formatted JSON object.
				</p>
				<a href="http://orwek.github.io/scripturematch" target="_blank" class="btn drop_dark" style="clear:both;">Matching Game</a>
				<p>
					This matching game was my first attempt at writing a browser game using JavaScript. It has given my children hours of entertainment. It is designed for two players and can be expanded to include more tilesets very easily.

			<h3>Graphic Artist</h3>
			<p>
			  I am an art enthusiast! This stems from my degree as a Techincal Theater major. I love to design things be it webpages, a book case, or lighting plots! My favorite mediums are acrylic, digital painting, and watercolor. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  I have also been known to break out my Cannon DSLR and have some fun with light painting, videography, and image editing.

			<h3>Author</h3>
			<p>
				As an independant author I have self-published three books. I have always loved writing, especially in the fantasy genre! You can find my books on <a href="http://amzn.to/2c1ksxF" target="_blank">Amazon</a> in paperback and Kindle editions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started writing for <a href="https://goidaho.com/author/kendallpurser/" target="_blank">GoIdaho.com</a> in August 2016. Go Idaho highlights the unique people and places that make Idaho what it is.

			<h3>YouTube</h3>
			<p>
			  I started my YouTube channel on a whim, and now over 35,000 views later here we are! I posted instructional videos for the game <a href="http://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a> as well as some short films that I had made, and soon the gaming videos took off! I have been publishing one a week ever since.
